    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chinese egg fried rice is an easy stir fry that anyone can make. But to make it light, fluffy and tasty, you need
        to follow some traditional tips and tricks.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>White rice, cooked and chilled</l1>
        <li>Eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>Scallions & garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Light soy sauce</li>
        <li>Sesame oil</li>
        <li>Salt & white pepper</li>
        <li>Neutral cooking oil (olive oil isn’t suitable)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Scramble the egg</h4>
            <p>Lightly beat the eggs until the white and yolk are well incorporated. </p>
            <p>Heat up an empty wok until it smokes. </p>
            <p>Pour in oil then add the beaten egg. You’ll see it quickly bubble up from the edge. </p>
            <p>Push it around to cook thoroughly then break the scrambled egg into small pieces. Dish out and set aside.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Fry the rice</h4>
            <p>Put the wok back on the burner to reheat. Add a little oil and fry minced garlic until it browns a
                little.</p>
            <p>Stir in the rice. Flip and toss constantly to heat the rice evenly. If there are still some clumps, press
                with a spatula to separate the rice grains. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Combine and season</h4>
            <p>Once the rice becomes piping hot, put in the scrambled egg and scallions. Add soy sauce, sesame oil, salt
                and white pepper.</p>
            <p>Give everything a good stir to evenly distribute the seasonings. Before dishing out, taste some to see if
                you need more salt.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Serve the dish</h3>
    <p>Egg fried rice makes a great breakfast or lunch on its own. If you fancy spicy food like me, add a dash of
        homemade chili oil for an extra kick, or other types of hot sauce, e.g. Laoganma, Sriracha, etc.</p>
